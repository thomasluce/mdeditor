    <blockquote>
    It is not that we have a short space of time, but that we waste much of it.
    Life is long enough, and it has been given in sufficiently generous measure
    to allow the accomplishment of the very greatest things if the whole of it
    is well invested. But when it is squandered in luxury and carelessness,
    when it is devoted to no good end, forced at last by the ultimate necessity
    we perceive that it has passed away before we were aware that it was
    passing. So it isâ€”the life we receive is not short, but we make it so, nor
    do we have any lack of it, but are wasteful of it. Just as great and
    princely wealth is scattered in a moment when it comes into the hands of a
    bad owner, while wealth however limited, if it is entrusted to a good
    guardian, increases by use, so our life is amply long for him who orders it
    properly.
